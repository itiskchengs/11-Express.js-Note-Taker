# 11-Express.js-Note-Taker

In this homework I worked with the code that was already provided. For this homework I built the server javascript to process the data coming from the front end and connect to the back end so it can read and write from the db.json file. you can write in the your title and text in the note and you save it and also delete if you are done with it.
